(autoload 'syslog-view "syslog-mode" "\
Open a view of syslog files with optional filters and highlights applied.
When called interactively the user is prompted for a member of `syslog-views' and the
arguments are determined from the chosen member.
FILES can be either nil in which case the view is applied to the current log file, or
it can be the same as the first argument to `syslog-get-filenames' - a list of cons
cells whose cars are filenames and whose cdrs indicate how many logfiles to include.
LABEL indicates whether or not to label each line with the filename it came from.
RXSHOWSTART, RXSHOWEND and RXHIDESTART, RXHIDEEND are optional regexps which will be
used to filter in/out blocks of buffer lines with `syslog-filter-lines'.
STARTDATE and ENDDATE are optional dates used to filter the lines with `syslog-filter-dates';
they can be either date strings or time lists as returned by `syslog-date-to-time'.
HIGHLIGHTS is a list of cons cells whose cars are regexps and whose cdrs are faces to
highlight those regexps with.
